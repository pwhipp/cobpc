                    This site is under construction and is here for testing and development purposes only.

            <p>Any domain name/url we own can be used to reference this. I can run it on one of my existing servers.
                We may be able to use the server currently being used for the website depending upon access/contract.</p>
            <p>This is a web service built using Django. Its good for customization and extension (much better than
                Wordpress) but requires a bit more work initially. Like Wordpress, there are many third party additions.</p>
            <p>I've not applied much in the way of styling but it can be styled however we like - everything is under
                our control.</p>
            <p>This can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be accessed as a link from the main site - which can go straight to login (unless persisted).</li>
                <li>Be styled however we like</li>
                <li>Replace the original site if we add blogging/news etc. Might take me an elapsed month or two -
                    benefits over time would include things like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>daily notices on the front page</li>
                        <li>rolling upcoming comps (with booking/status)</li>
                        <li>results (for members only)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    It can be set up for routine addition of articles and information etc. like wordpress but
                    changes to functionality may involve some python programming requiring knowledge of django
                    html and javascript.
