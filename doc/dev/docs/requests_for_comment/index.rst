Requests For Comment
====================

.. warning::

   The comment procedure is t.b.d


Any member can create an RFC. When the RFC has sufficient support or interest, it moves to being a proposal.

The proposal is voted on (probably by collecting signatures). If the proposal is passed it is adopted. If it fails it is archived in a rejected collection (so still searchable etc.)
