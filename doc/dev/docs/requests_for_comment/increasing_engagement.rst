Increasing Member Engagement
============================

Goal
----

To have more members volunteering and participating in the day to day operation and maintenance of the club

Proposal
--------

Use `gamification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification>`_.

For competition, this may be achieved by

- publishing easily reviewable results in the members portal for competitions
- using the working bee contribution in a more proactive way (perhaps 'karma' or 'members credits')
- an active blog that rewards members by citing them when they do stuff (like mowing etc.)
